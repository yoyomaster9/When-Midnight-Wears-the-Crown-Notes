# [[Silas Vane|Silas's]] letter to [[Urnok of the Shadow Current|Urnok]]
My apprentice… You learned much in the short time we had together. There is much more to learn but, now that you have conquered your first hurdle by defeating Taag you are ready for the next steps. You must leave this town. Find an adventure party. Learn the way of team fighting and how you flow with your party. Through this book and your adventures; your skills and knowledge will grow. Upon completion of this trial a man you may know well, Tomlin from Saltreach, will have a new trial for you to complete. I have scattered my knowledge from that book to places and people you must discover on your own, it’ll make sure you are sticking to adventuring otherwise you will never know your true capabilities. I have faith I will see you again and see your journey continue beyond what I can teach. Until then strike with the force o’ the current; kid.
