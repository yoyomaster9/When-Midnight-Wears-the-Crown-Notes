"Two cuts of veal, yer strongest ale, and a new rag, Tomlin." Urnok grumbles to the barkeep. Tomlin, lifting a bloody rag off Urnok's eye "Yeah, Taag got you good. Busted your brow." The words "Knockout!! Taag'Desh wins!" still ringing in Urnok's ears. Tomlin stands up, "Veal should be quick, only a few folk stay out this late. Mostly just, drunkards and pit los-" "He got lucky." Urnok interjects. 

Urnok stands up, recalling the shouting of the pits, the heated air, every blocked punch Urnok threw. The 7-foot burly orc caught him off-gaurd, landing a critical hook on Urnok's chin. The whole fight swirling like swimming in a sea storm, Urnok snaps back to reality, only to empty his stomach once again. "Bucket." Tomlin points. "Next time, he won't get lucky." Urnok grumbles and staggers back to his room, clutching at his wounds, his mind still muddled with every time he heard that word, "KNOCKOUT!!"

Still recoiling from the fight at the pits, Urnok stirs in his bed. He had hoped sailing with The Amber Tide would bring him a name worthy of his clan, but Stonehaven's pits prove difficult. Where the Ironfists were strong, bold, and resilient fighters, Urnok was weak and under-equipped. Leaving his clan wasn't easy, but was a necessary sacrifice. 

Night gives way to morning, Urnok rolls out of bed and into his less-bloodied deckhand clothes. Still clutching the bruises from the night prior, he trudges back to his post at The Amber Tide, a trading vessel used by several port towns to bring food and other tavern goods across the seas. Urnok begins winding rope and tying it down, while his mind drifts back to the fight. "Dodge the hook, 2-jab, block, bait, hook" he murmurs. Suddenly a man in an obviously over-the-top pirate's uniform pops in, 

"Runnin' the brawl back through yer head, eh? Tis a mark of a good fighter." 
Still caught off guard, Urnok says, 
"Who a-" 
"Name's Silas Vane. I'm comin' with ye this journey, headin' back ta Blackwater's Edge."
"Wha-"
"I’ll wager a handful o’ coin ye’ll best Taag next time. Let me show ye the ropes, eh?"
"Bu-"
"I caught the fight, lost some gold. Yer quick on yer feet--best use that speed, fight with precision, not strength, I'll show ye."

Silas lands a hand on Urnok's shoulder, shares a grin, and walks toward the hold, "Taag won’t even know what hit 'im!"

Through the next moon, the two shared their voyage sparring in the cargo hold and on moonlit deck nights. "Fight like the sea below—sense the ebb an' flow o' the waves, strike with the force o' the current." Silas would say. With many nights and even more bruises, Urnok felt he had learned the basis of Silas's martial arts.

"Bit o' a shame I’ll miss ye at Stonehaven. Take this—should help ye practice on the ride back." Silas hands Urnok an older-looking book, slightly worn with saltwater stained edges,  titled 'Shadow Current'. Glancing at the pages, Urnok sees the text contains different stances, poses, and abilities in line with Silas's martial arts. But before Urnok could even say anything, Silas had already walked away with the crowd of Blackwater's Edge.

With nothing but time and a curious book, Urnok tends to The Amber Tide by day and train at night. Another moon's travel back to Stonehaven, Urnok once again pays his deckhand wages to the pits, "Put me against Taag'Desh." he growls. Eager to test out his newfound strength, Urnok walks directly to the pit to find his opponent. 

With swiftness in his feet, Urnok dodges Taag's strikes, biding his time. Feeling the ebb and flow of battle, Urnok lands a few well-placed strikes on Taag. Taag stumbles, tries to counter with a strike of his own. Urnok deftly dodges, the strength of the current building, and strikes Taag's jaw with the entire force of the current. Taag falls with a heavy thud, "Knockout! Urnok wins!!"
